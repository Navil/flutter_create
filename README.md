# flutter_create

Submission for Flutter Create by Thomas Anderl.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple game. Several historical events will be shown in a random order.
Your job is to sort them in the correct order (ascending). So the list is supposed to start with
the earliest event and shall end with the most recent one.

## Requirements

The app was only tested on an Android device (Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus). As a result, I am unsure if the app behaves the same on iOS.
